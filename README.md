To Whom it may concern.

I finished the project models and write-ups well before the deadline.  However my knowledge of GitHub related to branches and creating gh-pages was such that the work was not uploaded before the deadline.

Please note that the Rmd in the Master branch is correct and I am working to get that rendered into an HTML pages for easier reading.

FYI - I beleive the problem is that I attached a file of the output Random Forrest Model that is required to render some of the statistics quoted in the write-up.  It unfotunately is very large and has created syncing issues with GitHub due to its size and that it appears to have been replicated in the web page subfolder.  I have create a .gitignore to help reduce the files included in the gitHub version of my working directories.  Hoepfully this will work :-)
